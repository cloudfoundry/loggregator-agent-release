      title: Syslog Agent Loss Rate
      description: |
        Indicates that the syslog drains are not keeping up with the number of
        logs that a syslog-drain-bound app is producing. This likely means that
        the syslog-drain consumer is failing to keep up with the incoming log
        volume.

        The recommended scaling indicator is to look at the maximum per minute
        loss rate over a 5-minute window and scale if the derived loss rate
        value grows greater than `0.1`.
      recommended_response: |
        Performance test your syslog server, review the logs of the syslog
        consuming system for intake and other performance issues that indicate a
        need to scale the consuming system.
