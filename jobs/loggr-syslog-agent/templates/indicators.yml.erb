    title: Syslog Agent Loss Rate
    description: |
      Indicates that the syslog drains are not keeping up with the number of
      logs that a syslog-drain-bound app is producing. This likely means that
      the syslog-drain consumer is failing to keep up with the incoming log
      volume.

      The recommended scaling indicator is to look at the maximum per minute
      loss rate over a 5-minute window and scale if the derived loss rate
      value grows greater than `0.1`.

    Performance test your syslog server, review the logs of the syslog
    consuming system for intake and other performance issues that indicate a
    need to scale the consuming system.
