      TLS loggregator root CA certificate. It is required for key/cert
      verification.

  tls.cipher_suites:
    description: |
      An ordered list of supported SSL cipher suites. Allowed cipher suites are
      TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 and TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384.

  cache.tls.ca_cert:
    description: |
      When the syslog communicates with the Cloud Controller it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's certificate was signed by a trusted CA.
      This is the CA trusted by the syslog for that communication.
  cache.tls.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to the Cloud Controller when initiating a
      connection. It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the Cloud
      Controller.
  cache.tls.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to the Cloud Controller
      when initiating a connection.
  cache.tls.cn:
    description: |
      When the syslog communicates with the cache it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's common name (CN) or subject alternative
      names (SANs) against the hostname or IP address used to initiate the
      connection. Most of the time this should be the hostname defined in
      api.url.
  cache.polling_interval:
    description: |
      The interval at which the syslog will poll the Cloud Controller for
      bindings.
    default: 15s
  cache.batch_size:
    description: |
      The batch size the syslog will request the Cloud Controller for
      bindings.
    default: 1000
