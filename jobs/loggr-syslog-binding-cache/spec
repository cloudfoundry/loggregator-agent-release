  api.tls.ca_cert:
    description: |
      When the syslog communicates with the Cloud Controller it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's certificate was signed by a trusted CA.
      This is the CA trusted by the syslog for that communication.
  api.tls.cert:
    description: |
      This certificate is sent to the Cloud Controller when initiating a
      connection. It must be signed by a CA that is trusted by the Cloud
      Controller.
  api.tls.key:
    description: |
      This is the private key for the certificate sent to the Cloud Controller
      when initiating a connection.
  api.tls.cn:
    description: |
      When the syslog communicates with the Cloud Controller it must
      validate the Cloud Controller's common name (CN) or subject alternative
      names (SANs) against the hostname or IP address used to initiate the
      connection. Most of the time this should be the hostname defined in
      api.url.
