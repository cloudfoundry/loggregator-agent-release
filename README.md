## Agents Architecture

![architecture]

### UDP Forwarder
Accepts the Loggregator v1 api over UDP and forwards it to a downstream Loggregator v2 consumer. 
This is available for backwards compatibility between the v1 API and the Forwarder, Syslog, or Loggregator agents.

### Forwarder Agent
A Loggregator v2 api multiplexer. This Agent Accepts Loggregator v2 and forwards to other agents colocated on the same VM
that accept Loggregator v2. To configure downstream agents, simply place a file named `ingress_port.yml` in the job's config
directory. [example][ingress-port]

### Syslog Agent
An agent that forwards app logs to a syslog drain. Drains are registered by binding User Provided Services to apps. 
Any logs coming from a registered app are forwarded to the configured endpoint. [docs][syslog-agent]

#### Syslog Binding Cache
Syslog Agents can overwhelm CAPI when querying for existing bindings. This component acts a a proxy for the CAPI Binding
query.

### Loggregator Agent
Loggregator Agent is a Cloud Foundry component that forwards logs and metrics
into the Loggregator subsystem. More information can be found in the [docs][loggregator-agent]

### Prom Scraper
A simple agent that reads from any local prometheus-scrapable endpoint and forwards the results to Loggregator.
Configurable via files in colocated bosh jobs as described in the [docs][prom-scraper]
scrapes are avoided in an HA environment.

### OTel Collector
This is the Cloud Foundry distribution of the OTel Collector. It accepts metrics in OTLP format and forwards them to any configured exporters.
More information can be found in the [OpenTelemetry docs](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector)
